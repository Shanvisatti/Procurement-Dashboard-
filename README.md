#Objective
This project examines the procurement strategies of Varav Biogenesis Private Limited, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, focusing on how the company adapted its supply chain and sourcing methods in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#Methodology
A mixed-method approach was used, including quantitative analysis of procurement data before and after the pandemic and qualitative insights from interviews with procurement officers and company executives. Key metrics such as procurement costs, lead times, supplier reliability, and stock levels were analyzed.

# Findings
Pre-COVID:

Stable Supplier Network: Varav Biogenesis maintained a steady and reliable network of 300–500 suppliers. The procurement process was efficient, with suppliers located in key cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Vapi), ensuring easy access to raw materials like Paracetamol IP, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole. Costs were manageable, and supplier response times ranged between 6–10 days.

Predictable Lead Times and Safety Stock: The company operated with lead times of 15–20 days for manufacturing and maintained safety stock based on average daily sales. For example, with a daily sale of 1000 units and a 15-day lead time, the company maintained 5000 units of buffer stock, which kept operations smooth without major delays.

Cost Efficiency: Raw material costs were relatively stable, allowing the company to focus on balancing cost with quality. The procurement team worked with consistent suppliers, using both formal and informal communication to maintain strong relationships and ensure timely delivery.

Post-COVID:

Severe Supply Chain Disruptions: The pandemic caused significant raw material shortages, particularly for APIs and Excipients. As a result, procurement costs for these materials surged, straining the company’s budget. The sudden disruption forced Varav Biogenesis to shift its focus from cost efficiency to securing supply continuity, even at higher costs.

Extended Lead Times: Average lead times increased from 4.92 to 7.80 days for Plant 1 and from 5.12 to 8.12 days for Plant 2, significantly impacting production timelines. The company had to adjust its procurement schedules to accommodate these delays, relying heavily on safety stock to prevent production shutdowns.

Adjusted Order Quantities: To mitigate the risk of stockouts, Varav Biogenesis recalibrated its minimum order quantities. For instance, post-pandemic, raw materials like ACECLOFENAC IP saw increased consumption due to heightened demand, forcing the company to place larger, more frequent orders to meet market needs. Conversely, materials like Alpha Lipoic Acid saw reduced demand, highlighting the uneven impact of the pandemic on different product lines.

Supplier Diversification: In response to pandemic-induced delays and cost increases, the company expanded its supplier base and began negotiating volume commitment contracts to secure priority access to essential raw materials. This shift aimed to reduce dependency on a few suppliers and enhance supply chain resilience.

Logistics Overhaul: With transportation systems disrupted, Varav Biogenesis enhanced its multimodal transport strategy by relying more on road and air transportation. This helped ensure more reliable delivery, though at higher costs.

#Key Comparisons:

Pre-COVID: The focus was on cost efficiency, maintaining predictable lead times, and managing a stable supply chain with minimal disruptions.
Post-COVID: The strategy shifted to survival and continuity—balancing cost spikes with the need for supply chain flexibility, increasing safety stock, and negotiating more favorable supplier terms to handle extended lead times.
#Implications
Varav Biogenesis faced significant challenges post-COVID, such as increased costs and delays, but their proactive adjustments—like recalibrating safety stock and expanding supplier relationships—helped them maintain operational continuity. The findings highlight the importance of a flexible procurement strategy to manage supply chain disruptions effectively.

#Recommendations
Make-or-Buy Analysis: To reduce reliance on external suppliers, the company should consider in-house production of key materials, especially for high-demand products.
Supplier Collaboration Platforms: Implementing platforms to share real-time data and forecasts with suppliers could improve procurement efficiency and reduce lead times.
Vulnerability Audit: Conducting audits of the supply chain to identify gaps and vulnerabilities will improve the company’s preparedness for future disruptions.
Conclusion
Varav Biogenesis's ability to adapt its procurement strategies during the pandemic demonstrates the importance of a resilient supply chain. This project underscores the value of strategic supplier management, safety stock policies, and data-driven decision-making to navigate unforeseen challenges in the pharmaceutical industry.
